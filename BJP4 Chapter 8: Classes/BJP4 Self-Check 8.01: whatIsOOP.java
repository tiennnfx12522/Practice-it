/*
Which of the following is an important difference between object-oriented programming and procedural programming?
a. Object-oriented programming was invented by Microsoft Corporation while procedural programming is 
invented by Apple for use on Macs.
b. Procedural programming treats a program as a sequence of actions or commands, while object-oriented programming 
looks at a program as a group of interacting entities named objects with related data and behavior.
c. Object-oriented programming is only possible in Java and not in other languages such as C++.
d. Object-oriented programming is more powerful and capable of solving a larger class of computational problems 
than procedural programming, which is much more limited and unable to be used in large projects.
e. Procedural programming is slower and less efficient than object-oriented programming.
