/*
What is an object? How is an object different from a class?
a. An object is a kind of class that does not contain any behavior (methods).
b. An object is not encapsulated and a class is encapsulated, making classes more powerful and reusable than objects.
c. An object is an entity that encapsulates related data and behavior, while a class is the blueprint for a type of 
objects.
d. A class is an instance of an object. One object can be used to create many classes.
e. Objects are used in object-oriented programming and classes are used in class-oriented programming.
