/*
For each of the following while loops, how many times will the loop execute its body?
Remember that "zero," "infinity," and "unknown" are legal answers.

a)
int x = 1;
while (x < 100) {
    System.out.print(x + " ");
    x += 10;
}
b)
int max = 10;
while (max < 10) {
    System.out.println("count down: " + max);
    max--;
}
c)
int x = 250;
while (x % 3 != 0) {
    System.out.println(x);
}
d)
int x = 2;
while (x < 200) {
    System.out.print(x + " ");
     x *= x;
}
*/

a. 10
b. zero
c. infinity
d. 3
