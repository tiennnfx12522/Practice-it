/*
The expression (0.2 + 1.2 + 2.2 + 3.2) should equal 6.8, but in Java it does not. Why not?
a. Java has a bug making it unable to add real numbers accurately, unlike other superior languages such as C++.
b. Real numbers are represented as imprecise floating-point numbers in the computer, and the limited precision led to a roundoff error.
c. Java is unable to perform a + expression involving so many numbers, so the code does not compile.
d. Those numbers are integers in Java, so the sum is 6.
e. The programmer forgot to cast the expression to type double, so the result is inaccurate.
